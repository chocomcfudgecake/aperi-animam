							<h4>The Ensemble</h4>
							<p>Aperi Animam, led by artistic director Daniel Koplitz, is a newly-formed ensemble of twelve voices based in Milwaukee, WI. The majority of the repertoire that the ensemble explores consists of sacred and secular music ranging from the first notated music to the early Baroque era. Through pure yet expressive choral singing and scholastic research, Aperi Animam aims to provide a sanctuary for their audience that inspires reflection and meditation.</p>

							<h4>The Requirements</h4>
							<p>Interested vocalists should possess a pleasurable and mature instrument, capable of healthy, straight-tone vocal production. In order for the rehearsal process to be expedient, sight-singing skills and knowledge of music theory are necessary. In addition, vocalists must be able to differentiate between solo performance and ensemble singing, regarding blend and volume in particular. Professionalism and flexibility are expected.
							</p>

							<h4>The Commitment</h4>
							<p>The ensemble will rehearse twice weekly in preparation for their concert season and other professional engagements including school run-outs, philanthropy concerts, and collaborations. Known engagements include a concert the evenings of October 1st, December 8th, and May 11th. Members are also expected to conduct assigned research outside of scheduled rehearsal time.</p>

							<h4>The Benefits</h4>
							<p>Members can expect a rehearsal environment that is both comfortable and educational where musicianship and style are explored extensively. Based out of the historic Cathedral of All Saints, members will have the opportunity to explore and perform within a space that is acoustically suited for this specific repertory.</p>

							<h4>The Audition</h4>
							<p>Auditions will take place at the Cathedral of All Saints (818 E. Juneau Ave., Milwaukee, WI) on
							August 13th and August 14th from 6pm-10pm. Interested vocalists will be asked to sight-sing and to perform a short selection provided in advance. A brief interview will follow. Contact executive director Jackie Willis at aperianimam@gmail.com to schedule an audition time and to receive your audition materials.</p>
